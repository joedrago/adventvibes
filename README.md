# AdventVibes

Oh dear, well, let me tell you about this... thing. It's called "Advent of Code" and I think it has something to do with Christmas? My grandson tried to explain it to me but I got distracted by a bird outside.

## What Is This, Exactly?

So apparently every December there's these little puzzles on the computer-web, and this here folder — or is it called a "repo"? Like a car repo? — anyway, this thing solves them. It's written in something called "Rust" which I thought was what happens to my garden tools when I leave them out in the rain, but no, it's a computer language. Like Spanish, but for computers, I suppose.

## How Do I Use It?

Now, my grandson wrote down these instructions for me on a napkin:

```
cargo run -- 1
```

That runs the first day's puzzle, I think? "Cargo" sounds like something you'd put on a ship. I don't know why we're putting things on ships to solve Christmas puzzles but that's what the young people do these days.

If you want to run ALL the puzzles (heaven knows why), you type:

```
cargo run -- all
```

## What Puzzles Are Done?

- **Day 1**: Something about a dial? And zeros? It reminded me of my old rotary phone, rest its soul. We got the right answers though: 1191 and 6858. Don't ask me what they mean.

## The Files and Such

- `src/` - This is where the "code" lives. It's all gibberish to me but apparently it's very organized.
- `inputs/` - The puzzle ingredients go here. Like a recipe, but for math.
- `CLAUDE.md` - Notes for the computer helper. Claude is helping us, he's very polite.
- `JOURNAL.md` - A diary of everything we've been chatting about. Very thorough.

## In Conclusion

I still don't really understand what's happening but everyone seems happy and that's what matters. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go find my reading glasses. They're probably on my head again.

The repository is actually a perfectly normal Advent of Code 2025 solution framework written in Rust. We apologize for any confusion, but also, isn't it kind of fun?)*
